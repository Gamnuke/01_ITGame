    <h1>Cube Quest: A Game Made By Shanuka</h1>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>
      As a part of the IT curriculumn at Uni High, we have been given the task of attempting to create a game
      using any program that was available at the time. Due to my prior knowledge about the new Unreal Engine 4,
      I have taken the time to learn and explore the fundamentals of C++ and UE4's variety of game development tools, to which I have
      successfully developed and published my first game using UE4: Cube Quest.

    <h3>About The Game</h3>
    <p>
      Cube Quest is a game designed by Shanuka(myself) and Harrison(My Partner). The game is a basic 3D side-view platformer game
      where the player is challenged to progress through three different levels of increasing difficulty, while bypassing certain
      obstacles. The game was then published after 10 weeks of development.
